Ensure a good code quality:

 * Follow the PEP8 standards: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. You can check this using the pep8 tool. (find . -name '*.py' -exec autopep8 -i {} \;)

 * Fix errors and warnings reported by pyflakes. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes

 * We use travis for continuous integration.
